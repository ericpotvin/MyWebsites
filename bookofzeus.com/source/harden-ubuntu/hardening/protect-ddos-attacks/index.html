<h2>Using ModEvasive</h2>

<p>The first think to do is to install <q>ModEvasive</q>. All details are provided in <a href="http://hardenubuntu.com/hardening/apache/modsecurity/">http://hardenubuntu.com/hardening/apache/modsecurity/</a>.</p>

<h2>Configuring UFW</h2>

<p>The following instructions can be added to the UFW rules. Edit the <q>/etc/ufw/before.rules</q>:</p>

<pre>
sudo vi /etc/ufw/before.rules
</pre>

<p>Add those lines after <q>*filter</q> near the beginning of the file:</p>
<code><pre>
:ufw-http - [0:0]
:ufw-http-logdrop - [0:0]
</pre></code>

<p>Add those lines near the end of the file, before the <q>COMMIT</q>:</p>
<code><pre>
### Start HTTP ###

# Enter rule
-A ufw-before-input -p tcp --dport 80 -j ufw-http
-A ufw-before-input -p tcp --dport 443 -j ufw-http

# Limit connections per Class C
-A ufw-http -p tcp --syn -m connlimit --connlimit-above 50 --connlimit-mask 24 -j ufw-http-logdrop

# Limit connections per IP
-A ufw-http -m state --state NEW -m recent --name conn_per_ip --set
-A ufw-http -m state --state NEW -m recent --name conn_per_ip --update --seconds 10 --hitcount 20 -j ufw-http-logdrop

# Limit packets per IP
-A ufw-http -m recent --name pack_per_ip --set
-A ufw-http -m recent --name pack_per_ip --update --seconds 1 --hitcount 20 -j ufw-http-logdrop

# Finally accept
-A ufw-http -j ACCEPT

# Log
-A ufw-http-logdrop -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 10 -j LOG --log-prefix "[UFW HTTP DROP] "
-A ufw-http-logdrop -j DROP

### End HTTP ###
</pre></code>

<h2>Prevent Ping Flood</h2>
<p>Make sure you don't get ping flood by setting some iptables rules that limit icmp. You can prevent ping/icmp flood with iptables add these rules right before the <q>COMMIT</q>.</p>
<code><pre>
-A INPUT -p icmp -m limit --limit 6/s --limit-burst 1 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
</pre></code>


<h2>Disable IPv6</h2>
<p>Before reloading all the rules, you need to make sure IPv6 is disable:</p>
<pre>
sudo vi /etc/default/ufw
</pre>
<p>Change the setting to <q>no</q>.</p>
<code><pre>
IPV6=no
</pre></code>

<p>Make sure ufw runs and reload everything:</p>
<pre>
sudo ufw reload
</pre>

<p class="note">If you get an error like this: <b>ERROR: problem running ufw-init</b>, simply delete the blank lines and manually insert new ones in their place. Most of the time this error is a bad copy and paste.</p>

<h2>Block IPs</h2>
<p>You can always banned black-listed IP addresses. Simply add the list of IP addresses in your apache2.conf under the <q>LIMIT</q> settings.</p>
