<p>The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code given certain conditions, by passing strings of code following environment variable assignments. Because of Bash's ubiquitous status amongst Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X distributions, many computers are vulnerable to Shellshock; all unpatched Bash versions between 1.14 through 4.3 (i.e. all releases until now) are at risk.</p>

<h2>Check System Vulnerability</h2>

<code>
<pre>
env VAR='() { :;}; echo Bash is vulnerable!' bash -c "echo Bash Test"
</pre>
</code>

<p>If you see this code, it means you are vulnerable</p>
<code>
<pre>
Bash is vulnerable!
Bash Test
</pre>
</code>

<h2>The fix</h2>
<pre>
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade bash
</pre>

<p>If you run the command again, you will see:</p>
<code>
<pre>
bash: warning: VAR: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `VAR'
Bash Test
</pre>
</code>
