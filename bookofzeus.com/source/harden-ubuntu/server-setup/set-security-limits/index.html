<p>You might need to protect your system against <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-bash-fork-bomb/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fork bomb</a> attacks. A simple way to prevent this is by setitng up processes limit for your users. All the limits can be configured in the <q>/etc/security/limits.conf</q> file.</p>

<pre>
sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf
</pre>

<p>This file comes with all the help you need. Here's an example:</p>
<code><pre>
user1 hard nproc 100
@group1 hard nproc 20
</pre></code>

<p>This will prevent users from a specific group from having a maximum of 20 processs and maximize the number of processes to 100 to user1.</p>
