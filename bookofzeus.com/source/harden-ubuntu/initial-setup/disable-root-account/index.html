<p>For security reasons, it is safe to disable the root account. Removing the account might not be a good idea at first, instead we simply need to disable it.</p>

<pre>
passwd --help | grep lock
  -l, --lock                    lock the password of the named account
  -u, --unlock                  unlock the password of the named account
</pre>

<p>To disable the root account, simply use the <q>-l</q> option:</p>
<pre>
sudo passwd -l root
</pre>

<p><b>If</b> for some valid reason you need to re-enable the account, simply use the <q>-u</q> option:</p>
<pre>
sudo passwd -l root
</pre>
