<p>You server probably already has bluetooth disabled or off. Just in case, you can double check and if the service is enable, here's how you can disable it.</p>

<p>To disable bluetooth service on startup, you can add the command to disable it in the <q>/etc/rc.local</q> file.</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>And set InitiallyPowered to false:</p>
<code><pre>
