<p>Apport is commonly known as the system that intercepts crashes right when happen the first time. It gathers potentially useful information about the crash and the OS environment. </p>
<p>If apport is currently active you can disable it.</p>

<pre>
sudo vi /etc/default/apport
</pre>

<p>and change the enabled to 0:</p>
<code><pre>
# set this to 0 to disable apport, or to 1 to enable it
# you can temporarily override this with
# sudo service apport start force_start=1
enabled=0
</pre> </code>

<h2>Removing apport</h2>

<p>If you really need to get rid of apport, you can remove it by executing this command:</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get purge apport
</pre>
