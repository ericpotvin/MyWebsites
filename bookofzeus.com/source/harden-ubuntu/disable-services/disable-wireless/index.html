<p>On any Ubuntu server, wirless needs to be disable, if of course it is enable.</p>

<p>First, let's disable the wireless network from the interface file:</p>
<pre>
sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
</pre>
<p>Add the following line:</p>
<code><pre>
iface wlan0 inet manual
</pre></code>

<p>NetworManager don't manage interfaces configured in the interfaces file. Replace wlan0 with the interface you want to disable, if it's not the name of the built-in interface.</p>

<p>Then restart network manager:</p>
<pre>
sudo service network-manager restart
</pre>
