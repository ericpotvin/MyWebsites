<h3>Use isEqualToString for string comparisons</h3>

<p>While working on my last project, I encountered few problems regarding "strings". On the simulator, everything worked well, but once
on the device, my app had a different behavior. I was using the basic double equals comparison:</p>

<pre>
if (MyObject.name != value1) {
   // The rest of my code ...
}
</pre>

<p>After spending few times on that issue, I realize I was comparing a NSString-typed property to a NSString variable. Therefore, I was supposed to use the "isEqualToString" comparison method instead of the double equal comparison:</p>

<pre>
if ([MyObject.name isEqualToString:value]) {
   // The rest of my code ...
}
</pre>

<p>In the iPhone Simulator (running on 10.6.2) this comparison returned false, but on the iPhone running 3.1.2 it returned true. </p>

<p class="note">Never assume your result will be the same from simulator and the device.</p>



<h3>The Compare Method</h3>
<p>NSString object have a method called "compare". That method gives you the ability to get the difference between the two (2) strings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>both string are identical</li>
    <li>the comparing string is in ascending sort order from the other string</li>
    <li>the comparing string is in descending sort order from the other string</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre>
NSString *str = @"ubuntu";
NSComparisonResult result = [str compare:@"apple"];

switch (result) {
	case NSOrderedAscending:
		// Ascending code
		break;
	case NSOrderedSame:
		// Same code
		break;
	case NSOrderedDescending:
		// Descending code
		break;
	default:
		break;
}
</pre>

<p>You can also use the "caseInsensitiveCompare" if you like to compare these strings using case with case sensitivity.</p>
