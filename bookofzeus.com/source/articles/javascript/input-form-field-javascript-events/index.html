<p>Remember when we use to create custom functions for filtering data input in a web forms?</p>

<p>Well, now we don't have to. Some of them are very intuitive and avoid creating these functions we need to make sure the user won't cheat while filling out a form.</p>

<p>Here's few I personally like and are very useful:</p>

<ul>
 <li>oncopy</li>
 <li>onpaste</li>
 <li>oncut</li>
</ul>

<h4>Code</h4>
<pre>
&lt;input type="text" name="field" oncopy="return false;" maxlength="32" onpaste="return false;" oncut="return false;" size="30" /&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Demo</h4>
<p>
<input type="text" name="field" oncopy="return false;" maxlength="32" onpaste="return false;" oncut="return false;" size="30" />
</p>
<p>Easy no? Of course there's more and I won't here list all of them, but before start developing, remember to check if this is not already done for you!</p>
