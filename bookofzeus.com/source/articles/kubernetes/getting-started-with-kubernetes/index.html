<h2>Start minikube</h2>

<p>
    The first step we need to do is to start the Kubernetes cluster.
    To do so, we need to use the "start" <a href="/articles/kubernetes/kubernetes-commands">command</a>.
</p>
<pre>
minikube start
</pre>

<p class="note">
    If the "~/.minikube/" folder does not exists, minikube will automatically download the ISO files.
</p>

<p>
    The output will looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
Starting local Kubernetes v1.10.0 cluster...

Loading cached images from config file.
</pre>

<p>
    We can verify to make sure all is good:
</p>

<pre>
minikube status
</pre>

<p>
    This will show the status and the IP address of the cluster.
</p>
<pre>
minikube: Running
cluster: Running
kubectl: Correctly Configured: pointing to minikube-vm at 192.168.99.100
</pre>

<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>
    Now let's navigate to the dashboard.
</p>
<pre>
minikube dashboard
</pre>

<!-- -->
<h2>Create a test deployment</h2>

<p>
    Kubernetes comes with a "hello-minikube" to play and test deployment.
    Kubernetes deployments manage stateless services running on your cluster
    (as opposed to for example StatefulSets which do manage stateful services).
    Their purpose is to keep a set of identical pods running and upgrade them in a controlled way â€“ performing a rolling update by default.
</p>

<h3>Create and run the deployment</h3>

<pre>
kubectl run hello-minikube --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.10 --port=8080
</pre>

<p>
    The output should show "deployment.apps "hello-minikube" created".
    This means now the "hello-minikube" deployment is added to the dashboard.
    If you refresh your dashboard, you should see it.
</p>

<h3>Expose the deployment</h3>
<pre>
kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort
</pre>
<p>
    This will now expose and launch a new deployment and create the service for it.
</p>

<h3>List the pod</h3>
<pre>
kubectl get pods
</pre>

<p>
    This will show the newly created pod:
</p>
<pre>
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-minikube-7c77b68cff-tvgrt   1/1       Running   0          7m
</pre>

<h3>See it in action!</h3>
<p>
    This newly service can be access from your Internet browser.
    You can find the URL to load in the "Discovery and load balancing / Services / hello-minikube" or by running this command:
</p>
<pre>
minikube service hello-minikube --url
</pre>

<!-- -->
<h2>Delete the service</h2>
<p>
    If a service is not required anymore, we can remove it from the cluster.
</p>
<pre>
kubectl delete services hello-minikube
kubectl delete deployment hello-minikube
kubectl delete pods hello-minikube-7c77b68cff-tvgrt # you can get this name using the "kubectl get pods" command
</pre>
