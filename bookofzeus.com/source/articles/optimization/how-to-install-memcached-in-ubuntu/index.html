<h4>What is MemCached?</h4>
<p>"MemCached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but originally intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load."</p>

<p>Basically, it means it save and retrieve data in the server memory. This is typically used to remove the loads on the database server.</p>

<p>The logic of MemCached is very simple:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You verify if MemCached has the data you need, if so you simply use it.</li>
 <li>if not, you save the data into MemCached and then use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>run the following command to install memcached:</p>
<pre>
sudo aptitude install memcached
</pre>

<p>If you want to change the default settings, simply create the file and update the configuration.</p>
<p>First, create memcached configuration file:</p>
<pre>
vi /etc/memcached.conf
</pre>

<p>Then, change the settings:</p>
<pre>
# Memory a usage in Mb
-m 16
# default port
-p 11211
# user to run daemon nobody/apache/www-data or else
-u nobody
# only listen locally
-l 127.0.0.1
</pre>

<p>Save and quit the file. Once this is complete, don't forget to restart the daemon:</p>
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/memcached restart
</pre>

<p>Now lets install for php</p>
<pre>
sudo aptitude install php5-memcached
</pre>

<p>Restart both services:</p>
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/memcached restart ; sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</pre>
