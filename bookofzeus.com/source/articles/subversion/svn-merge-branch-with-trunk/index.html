<p>Here's a quick article on how to merge your branch to your trunk assuming you already in your working copy (using <code>svn co</code> and your current changes are committed (using <code>svn ci</code>) in your branch.</p>

<h4>Switch to the trunk</h4>
<pre>
svn switch ssh://svnserver/myproject/trunk
</pre>

<h4>Find the revision</h4>
<p>In the branch directory, run:</p>
<pre>
svn log --stop-on-copy
</pre>
<p>
This will display the changes that has been made to the point the branch was created. You will see something like:
</p>
<pre>
rXXXX
</pre>

<h4>Merging to the trunk</h4>
<pre>
svn merge -rXXXX:YYYY ssh://svnserver/branch/myBranch
</pre>
<p>This will copy your new code from your working branch for the trunk.</p>

<h4>Committing the changes</h4>
<pre>
svn ci -m "MERGE branch to the trunk"
</pre>
