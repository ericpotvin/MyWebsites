<p>Have you ever forgot to take a backup of your files? or even modify them and wanted to rollback to the previous version but, unfortunately, you don't have the previous version?</p>
<p>Whether it is a WebSite, personal documents, or any other project you working on, there is a simple solution to fix this issue; it's called <span class="bold">SubVersion</span>.</p>

<p>Some websites offers you to host your project for you, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Google Code</li>
    <li>SourceForge</li>
</ul>

<p>But if you want more control on your repository and you don't want to pay monthly cost, you should install <span class="bold">SubVersion</span> on your Ubuntu.</p>
<p>The process for installing subversion on Ubuntu and repository is simple. All the tools you will need to use <span class="bold">SubVersion</span> are included in the subversion package.</p>

<h3>Get SubVersion</h3>
<pre>
sudo aptitude install subversion
</pre>

<h3>Setup a group</h3>

<p>First, create a group named <span class="italic">svn</span> and then add your account to that group.</p>
<pre>
sudo addgroup svn
sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" svn
</pre>

<h3>Setup the Repository home folder</h3>
<p>In order to be able to use, create a repository home folder:</p>
<pre>
sudo mkdir -p /svn/repository
</pre>

<p>Give access to the <span class="italic">svn</span> group.</p>
<pre>
sudo chgrp -R svn /svn/repository
sudo chmod -R 770 /svn/repository
</pre>
<p>To make sure the changes you made takes effect relating the security <span class="italic">svn</span> group, A logout of the GUI/shell and re-login is sufficient to re-read the permissions.</p>

<h3>Create a new repository project</h3>
<p>To create your project repository, use the <span class="italic">svnadmin</span> command:</p>
<pre>
svnadmin create /svn/repository/my_project
</pre>


<h3>Create a SVN user</h3>
<p>You will also need user who will need access to the repository. To create a user, use the following command:</p>
<pre>
vi /svn/repository/my_project/conf/svnserve.conf
</pre>

<p>and add to that file these three lines:</p>
<pre>
anon-access = none
auth-access = read
password-db = passwd
</pre>

<p>After, create a password file or edit the current one:</p>
<pre>
vi /svn/repository/my_project/conf/passwd
</pre>

<p>In that file add a line for your user:</p>
<pre>
myuser = mypassword
</pre>

<h3>Setup the SVN server Daemon</h3>

<p>You can run manually the daemon on the host computer using the svnserve command:</p>
<pre>
svnserve -d -r /svn/repository
</pre>

<p>Or, you can setup to run automatically:</p>
<p>Simply create a new file (I called mine svnserve) and type the command youâ€™d like to run</p>
<pre>
cd /etc/init.d/
sudo echo "svnserve -d -r /svn/repository/my_project" > svnserve
</pre>

<p>Make the script executable</p>
<pre>
sudo chmod +x svnserve
</pre>

<p>Add the script to the boot sequence</p>
<pre>
sudo update-rc.d svnserve defaults
</pre>

<h3>Import Your Project</h3>
<p>Now that you have your project repository up and running, you will be able to add files and folders in it.</p>
<pre>
svn import /svn/repository/my_project file:///repository/my_project
</pre>

<h3>Checkout Your Project</h3>
<p>Now your project is stored in your repository. You will need to check it out to work on it and make changes. </p>
<pre>
cd /my/www/path/
svn co file:///repository/my_project my_project
</pre>

<h3>Create a trunk and branches folders</h3>
<p>If you are the only user working on your project, you can create the <span class="italic">trunk</span> folder:</p>
<pre>
cd /my/www/path/
mkdir trunk
svn add trunk
svn commit -m "Added trunk folder"
</pre>

<p>If you have more than one developers working on your project, you can create the branches folders.</p>
<pre>
cd /my/www/path/
mkdir branch
svn add branch
svn commit -m "Added branch folder"
</pre>

<p><span class="bold">Done!</span> Enjoy your repository and feel free to update your code without thinking of taking backups every time the code has change.</p>
