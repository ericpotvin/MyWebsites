<p>When I upgraded my version of Ubuntu I noticed right away the new scrollbars in my applications. At first, it was kinda cool but after a little while it was not really what I needed.</p>

<p>Here's a quick tip on how to remove the overlay scrollbars in your Ubuntu application</p>

<pre>
sudo su
echo "export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0" > /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80overlayscrollbars
</pre>

<p>Logout then login</p>

<p>If this solution doesn't work for you, you will need to remove the overlay scrollbars packages.</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get remove overlay-scrollbar liboverlay-scrollbar-0.1-0
</pre>
