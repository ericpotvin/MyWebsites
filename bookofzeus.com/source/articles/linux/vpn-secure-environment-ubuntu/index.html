<p>VPN (virtual private network) extends a private network and the resources contained in the network across public networks like the Internet. It enables a host computer to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were a private network with all the functionality, security and management policies of the private network.[1] This is done by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated connections, encryption, or a combination of the two.</p>

<p>Ubuntu does not come with the VPN tool and for those who needs it, here's what to do.</p>

<h4>Install Java JDK</h4>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk icedtea-7-plugin
</pre>

<h4>Install Juniper VPN Software</h4>
<pre>
mkdir ~/juniper_temp
cd ~/juniper_temp
wget https://github.com/udomsak/juniper-ncui/raw/master/ncLinuxApp.jar
jar xf ncLinuxApp.jar
chmod +x ./getx509certificate.sh
./getx509certificate.sh <q>IP_OF_THE_SECURE_ENV</q> ~/.vpn-secure.crt
chmod go-rwx ~/.vpn-secure.crt
chmod a+x ./ncsvc
</pre>

<h4>Run</h4>
<p>
Run this in a console, it will ask you for your password (don't run it in the background) It will keep running until you stop it.
</p>
<pre>
sudo ./ncsvc -h <q>IP_OF_THE_SECURE_ENV</q> -u <q>username</q> -f ~/.vpn-secure.crt
</pre>

<p>
Once the password is entered, the connection will be now open to the secure environment. Simply open a new console and type:
</p>

<pre>
ssh <q>IP_OF_THE_SECURE_ENV</q>
</pre>

<p>Then to close the connection from the secure environment, simply hit <kbd>control-c</kbd> from the process that was running in the other console.</p>
