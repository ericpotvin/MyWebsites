<p>Yesterday I plugged my old MAC OS hard drive to see what's on it and re-format to use it as a backup. But first, I wanted to know what's on it to make sure I don't remove files I need.</p>

<p>But of course, I couldn't read it. So, I did some digging to make sure I read it properly. So I found about <q>hmount</q>.
hmount is used to introduce a new HFS volume. A UNIX pathname to the volume's source must be specified. The source may be a block device or a regular file containing an HFS volume image. </p>

<p>Sounds easy right? well it's that easy!</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install hfsutils
</pre>

<p>So, this will show something like this:</p>
