<p>The "mail" command is commonly use to send email from the console without attachment. Here's a simple example of sending an email to "someone@domain.com" using "subject of the email" as the subject:</p>

<pre>
echo 'some message' | mail -s 'subject of the email' someone@domain.com
</pre>

<p>Let's CC someone else:</p>
<pre>
echo 'some message' | mail -s 'subject of the email' -c someoneelse@domain.com someone@domain.com
</pre>

<p>Now let's BCC someone else:</p>
<pre>
echo 'some message' | mail -s 'subject of the email' -c someoneelse@domain.com -b someoneimportant@domain.com someone@domain.com
</pre>

<p>If you already have your message save in a text file, you can use the following syntax:</p>
<pre>
mail -s 'subject' someone@domain.com &lt; /tmp/messagePlease
</pre>

<h2>Sending email with attachment from the shell</h2>

<p>If you are looking to send email with attachment from the shell prompt, you will need to use the "mutt" tool. Mutt is a powerful text based program for reading electronic mail under Linux. Mutt requires a valid email server and a working mail transfer agent (sendmail, postfix) installed in order to successfully send emails.</p>
<p>First, let's install mutt (if it's not installed)</p>
<pre>
sudo aptitude install mutt
</pre>

<p>Use the following syntax to send an email with an attachment:</p>
<pre>
echo "some message" | mutt -s "subject of the email" -a /home/user/my-file.bzip someone@domain.com
</pre>

<p class="note">The same parameters are used in mutt to CC or BCC someone.</p>
