<p>VIM (or VI) is a powerful tool that allow developer to create or update code. But there's something I found annoying in this tool: "Matching parenthesis". Matching parenthesis can be very useful when you edit file, but if you don't like it how can you get rid of it?</p>

<p>First, open your vimrc file:</p>
<pre>
vi ~/.vimrc
</pre>

<p>and simply add the following code in your vimrc file:</p>
<pre>
let g:loaded_matchparen=1
</pre>

<p>Now open your file again! Enjoy ;)</p>
