<p>I recently had to use my VPN client to connect to work but for some reason the VPN didn't work correctly. After some digging, I found out I need the need to install ncui rpm package (ncui-1.2-1.i386.rpm & ncui-6.5R6.i386.rpm). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find the Debian package (.deb) so I had to find a solution.</p>

<h2>Alien is the answer</h2>

<p>First, let's install alien:</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install alien
</pre>

<p>Now we need to convert them to .deb package.</p>
<p>You can convert the rpm package to a Debian package by using the following commands:</p>
<pre>
sudo alien -k rpm-package.rpm
</pre>

<p class="note">The "-k" option will keep the version number.</p>
<p>One the package is converted, you can install the Debian package by using the following commands:</p>
<pre>
sudo dpkg -i deb-package.deb
</pre>
