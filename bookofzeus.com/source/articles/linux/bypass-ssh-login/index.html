<p>If you are using SSH a lot (either to connect from your development environment or production environment) you will be prompted to enter your password:</p>
<pre>
user@server.com's password:
</pre>

<p>This can be annoying when you connect to these servers over and over. Here's a quick tip that will allow you not to enter your password every time you login and keep your connection between your computer and your server secure.</p>

<h4>On your computer</h4>
<pre>
cd ~/.ssh
</pre>

<p>Then execute:</p>
<pre>
ssh-keygen -t dsa
</pre>

<p>For each question, simply press the enter key at every prompt. This will output something like (this may vary):</p>
<pre>
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_dsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
ad:98:43:13:c9:ea:66:8e:d0:d9:66:59:d8:3a:f7:29
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ DSA 1024]----+
|                 |
|     . .         |
|      +          |
|     + . .       |
|    o = S .      |
| . + = + .       |
|. o @ = .        |
| . B oEo .       |
|  . .  .o        |
+-----------------+
</pre>

<p>This produces two files: id_dsa.pub (public key) and id_dsa (private key)</p>
<pre>
user@computer:~/.ssh$ ll
total 40
-rw------- 1 user user  668 2011-11-29 13:26 id_dsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  604 2011-11-29 13:26 id_dsa.pub
</pre>

<h4>On your server</h4>
<p>Edit the file <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. Note: the file might not be there</p>
<pre>
vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>

<p>Copy the content from the public key (id_dsa.pub) in the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and change the permissions:</p>
<pre>
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
</pre>
<p>Logout of your server, and login again! the password is now gone!</p>

<p>If by any bad luck you are getting this error:</p>
<p class="note">Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.</p>
<p>Simply, run:</p>
<pre>
ssh-add
</pre>
