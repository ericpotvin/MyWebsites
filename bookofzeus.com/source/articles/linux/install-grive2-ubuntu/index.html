<p>Do you backup your files manually? or do you even backup your files?</p>

<p>If you say yes to at least one of the question above, it's time to setup your backup.</p>

<p>Google Drive provides functionality to backup your files on the Google Cloud. This can be done manually by opening Firefox or Chrome and manually uploading files.</p>

<p>Now, if you do not want to manually, you need to install <a href="https://github.com/vitalif/grive2" target="_blank">Grive2</a>.</p>

<p>Grive2 is a tool that will allow you to backup your files to Google Drive without login via an Internet browser.</p>

<h3>Install Grive2</p>
<p>First, let's add the Grive2 repository</p>
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
</pre>

<p>Now, let's install it</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grive
</pre>

<h3>Setup your backup folder<h3>
<p>You can either use an existing folder or create a new one, for example:</p>
<pre>
mkdir -p ~/backup
cd ~/backup
</pre>

<p>Now, before you can start backup, you need to grant it permission to access your Google Drive:</p>
<pre>
grive -a
</pre>

<p>This will give you a Google URL that generates a unique token. This token is use to sync data between your computer and Google Drive.</p>

<p>You should see something like (on the Internet browser) and youâ€™ll be asked to give Grive permission to access your Google Drive and after clicking <q>Allow access</q>. One you allowed the access, you will see a private key or token:</p>
<pre>
Please copy this code, switch to your application and paste it there:
[ MY_VERY_LONG_PRIVATE_KEY ]
</pre>

<p>Copy and paste the private key to the shell.</p>

<h3>Backup</h3>
<p>Every time you need to backup files, simply run:</p>
<pre>
grive
</pre>

<h3>Automated backup<h3>
<p>If you want to automatically backup files, you can <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto" target="_blank">setup a cronjob</a>.
This will allow to automatically run your backup.</p>

<p>The important thing you have to make sure is you need to make sure you get the full path of the grive tool by running:</p>
<pre>
which grive
</pre>
